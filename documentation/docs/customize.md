## Customize icons

You can add icons to src/icons and run gulp build-icons. This will make the icons available for use in the contextmenu using the icon property.

So for example the file checkmark.svg wil result in the CSS context-menu-icon-checkmark which you can use by using the [icon option](items#icon) when defining a menu item.


## Customize CSS

You can use the _variables.scss to adjust variables on pretty much everything you want to change.
